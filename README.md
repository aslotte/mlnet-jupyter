#### Jupyter Notebook + ML.NET 
As of MS Ignite 2019, ML.NET can now be run in a Jupyter Notebook. This provides tons of benefits, such as data exploration, summary statistics and increased sharability of code. 

The repository provides multiple examples on how to get started with ML.NET in Jupyter Notebooks.

The following ML Tasks are included:
1. Binary Classification
2. Multi-class classification
3. Time-series forecasting
4. Image classification (Tensorflow)

#### Getting started
To run the notebooks locally:
1. Install Jupyter Notebooks, e.g. via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
2. Follow the [following instructions to install the C# Kernel](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cesardelatorre/using-ml-net-in-jupyter-notebooks/) 
3. Clone/Fork this repo and start the notebooks in e.g. JupyterLabs
